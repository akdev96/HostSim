# **App Name**: HostSim

## Core Features:

- Interactive Network Simulations: Users can interact with visual simulations of network protocols like TCP, DHCP, and DNS to understand how they work. Includes tools for visualizing packet exchanges and protocol states.
- Systems Process Simulations: Interactive simulations to explore concepts such as Process Scheduling, CPU Pipelining or Memory Management. Allow for visualizing the operation of common algorithms using UI tools.
- Cybersecurity Attack Simulations: Simulate common cybersecurity attacks and defenses to demonstrate vulnerabilities and security measures.
- Code Tutor: When a simulation involves writing a snippet of code or setting a config, use an LLM to give users feedback about improving the code or config they wrote. Acts as a helpful tool rather than blindly telling them what to write.
- Simulation Search and Discovery: Enable users to find simulations by type or topic.
- Curated Learning Paths: Provide users with suggested sets of simulations and tutorials to follow to learn about specific topics.
- Mobile-Responsive Design: Ensure the application is fully responsive and usable on various screen sizes.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: HSL(203, 88%, 55%) - A vibrant, attention-grabbing blue. Hex code: #3FD0FF
- Background color: HSL(208, 25%, 13%) - A desaturated dark blue that provides contrast without overwhelming. Hex code: #1A212B
- Accent color: HSL(173, 58%, 50%) - An analogous, brighter green to complement the primary blue. Hex code: #36D398
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', sans-serif, for a clean, modern, and readable experience.
- Use minimalist icons to represent different types of simulations and categories.
- Employ a modular design with clear visual hierarchy to guide users through simulations and content.
- Incorporate subtle animations on UI elements to provide feedback and enhance user engagement.
